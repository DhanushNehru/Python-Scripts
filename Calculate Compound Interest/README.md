# Compound Interest Calculator

A simple Python program to calculate the future value of your savings with **compound interest**.

## How it works
- Enter:
  - Number of years  
  - Current balance  
  - Monthly investment  
  - Annual interest rate (in decimal, e.g., 0.1 = 10%)  
- The program calculates your final amount after compounding yearly.

## Run
```bash
python compound_interest.py
```

## Example

```
Enter years: 5
Enter current amount in account: 1000
Enter amount: 200
Enter interest in decimal numbers (10% = 0.1): 0.1
```

Output:

```
This is how much money you would have in your account after 5 years: 3960.0
```

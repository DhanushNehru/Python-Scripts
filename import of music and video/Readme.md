## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3 installed.
- The [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library installed. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
**Usage**
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Run the script using Python:
bash
python video_player.py
Click the "Open Video File" button to select an MP4 or AVI video file from your computer.

The selected video file will be played using the OpenCV-based video player.


**Troubleshooting**
If you encounter any issues while using the video player, please consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Verify that opencv-python is installed by running pip show opencv-python.
3. Check your system's video codec support and audio settings.
